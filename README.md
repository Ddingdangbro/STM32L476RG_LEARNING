# STM32L476RG_LEARNING
This project aims to document the learning process of STM32L476RG and Hardware Abstraction Layer(HAL). This project is based on the NUCLEO-L476RG development board and is generated by the STM32CubeMX.


CONTENTS:
1. STM32L476RG_GPIO: Press the button to toggle LED2
2. STM32L476RG_USART_INTERUPT: Sending and reciving interupt by USART(Asynchronous)
3. STM32L476RG_PWM: Breathing light
4. STM32L476RG_TIMER_INTERUPT: Chang the state of the LED2 (Period of Interupt: 1s)
5. STM32L476RG_INPUTCAPTURE: Output a PWM(Frequency:1kHz, Duty:50%) and capture it, print the frequency\duty\high level time and low level time by usart
